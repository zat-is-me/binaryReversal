# This is the question I recieved from recruiter 
Have the function App(str) take the str parameter being passed, 
which will be a positive integer, take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N * 8 bits), 
reverse that string of bits, and then finally return the new reversed string in decimal form.
For example: if str is &quot;47&quot; then the binary version of this integer is 101111
but we pad it to be 00101111. Your program should reverse this binary
string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal version of this string,
which is 244.
